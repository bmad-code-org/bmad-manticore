# Using an OGraf graphic in DaVinci Resolve 21 / Fusion

OGraf HTML graphics and Lottie are native in **Resolve 21+** (not 20.x). Resolve drives OGraf in **non-real-time** mode — it renders frame-by-frame via `goToTime`, so the graphic must declare `supportsNonRealTime: true` and implement `goToTime` (the scaffold does). The message *"Resolve and Fusion currently only support non-real time OGraf files"* is informational, not an error.

## Import (Edit/Cut page)

1. Keep the package **folder** intact — `*.ograf.json` + the `.mjs` + any assets together. The manifest loads its `main` and assets relative to itself.
2. Drag the **`*.ograf.json`** into the Media Pool **from inside that folder** (so Resolve resolves the siblings). It appears as a clip with alpha.
3. Drop the clip on a track above your footage. Transparency composites automatically — no matte.
4. Select the clip and edit the schema fields in the **Inspector** (Title, Subtitle, etc. — whatever the manifest `schema` exposes).

## Fusion

Use the **OGrafLoader** node (added in 21) and point it at the manifest to bring the graphic into the node graph.

## Black-screen troubleshooting

A black clip has no error dialog, so check these in order:

1. **Imported only the `.json`?** That orphans it from its `.mjs`/assets. Re-import the `.json` from inside the intact folder.
2. **The `.mjs` calls `customElements.define()`?** Remove it. Resolve registers the class; self-registration throws *"this constructor has already been used with this registry"* → load fails, **no Inspector fields appear** (this is the tell: no fields = didn't load).
3. **No Inspector fields at all?** The graphic didn't load (see #1/#2) or the manifest `schema` is empty/malformed.
4. **Loads but renders blank?** An asset/font load threw (wrap in `try/catch`), or the graphic sized itself to the host's `clientHeight` which was `0` (fill the host instead).
5. **Still the old broken render after a fix?** Resolve **caches** the clip — delete it from the Media Pool (and timeline) and re-import.
6. Confirm Resolve is **21.0+**.

Run `uv run scripts/verify_ograf.py <package-dir>` first — it reproduces #2 and #4 headlessly before you ever open Resolve.

## Previewing locally before Resolve

Serve the folder and open `preview.html` over HTTP: `uv run python -m http.server 8771` in the package folder, then open `localhost:<port>/preview.html` (verify_ograf.py prints per-OS steps and, from a human terminal, serves and opens the preview itself). **Never double-click `preview.html` (`file://`)**: the browser blocks its ES-module import and inlined data-URL assets, so the graphic silently fails while the controls/checkerboard still show ("Some content has been disabled"). This is a browser preview limit only; Resolve's renderer is unaffected.

## Scripted import on free Resolve (Fusion Scripts menu)

Resolve's external scripting API is Studio-only through Resolve 21; the free edition only executes scripts launched from inside the app (Console or Workspace > Scripts). To run the pipeline's scripted timeline import (resolve_import.py, once implemented) on free Resolve, copy the script into the Fusion Scripts folder and launch it from Workspace > Scripts:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Blackmagic Design/DaVinci Resolve/Fusion/Scripts/Utility/`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Support\Fusion\Scripts\Utility\`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/DaVinciResolve/Fusion/Scripts/`

This upgrades the free lane from manual FCPXML import to native scripted import with zero dependencies.

## Linux free-edition codec caveat

The Linux free edition cannot decode or encode H.264 or H.265 and has no AAC at all. The FCPXML timeline imports fine, but mp4/AAC media is undecodable there; transcode sources to ProRes or DNxHR first, or use Resolve Studio.

## Studio power lane: Resolve MCP (opt-in)

Studio users who want conversational post-import work (timeline surgery, Text+ titles, markers, render-queue automation) can opt into the community [samuelgursky/davinci-resolve-mcp](https://github.com/samuelgursky/davinci-resolve-mcp) server (MIT, macOS/Windows/Linux; Studio-only, because it uses the external scripting API). Manticore keeps doing media import and timeline construction itself through the FCPXML lane and never requires an MCP server; record an already-running server via mc-setup's `[mcp]` step if you want skills to use it.
